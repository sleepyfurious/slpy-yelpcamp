# Slpy's YelpCamp
YelpCamp is a Node.js web application from The Web Developer Bootcamp[ยน](#credits). A plain and simple social network website for my learning and demonstration. This project, Slpy's YelpCamp, is my version of YelpCamp. I started versioning it at revision 2 of YelpCamp (YelpCamp_v2). I'll code to achieve almost the same result as the final version in the course, v11, but with possibilities of some minor adjustments to my preference and some additional features. The goal is to learn full-stack web development try some relevant coding skills. See pending development note here: [readme__dev_list.md](readme__dev_list.md).

Slpy's YelpCamp has deviated from YelpCamp_v11 with the following additions:
* The use of some element of modern JavaScript like arrow function, more to come...
* The new and edit forms are DRY up in single EJS template instead of two separated one for both campgrounds and comments.

## Launching app for local development
The code use environment variables to supply site-specific configuration. Currently, supplying the following environment variable is required:
* DATABASEURL: The app use MongoDB to store data. This specifies URL to an instance of database.
* PORT: A port number for application to respond via the web.

For example, to start the application on the server in Bash with registered port 3000 and MongoDB instance on localhost, you may start it with the following CLI script in the root directory of this project: 
```bash
export PORT=3000
export DATABASEURL="mongodb://localhost/yelp_camp"
node app.js
```

This creates a quick and dirty Bash script that launches it all (both mongod and our node app) easily:
```bash
echo "\
\
# Prepare and launch an instance of MongoDB in background, then config and 
# launch the app.

# MongoDB
proc_stat=\`ps -A\`
if ! ( echo \"\$proc_stat\" | grep mongod ); then
  mkdir -p local_data
  mongod -dbpath=local_data --nojournal&
fi

# the app
export PORT=3000
export DATABASEURL=\"mongodb://localhost/yelp_camp\"
node app.js
\
" > ./local_serve && chmod +x local_serve

# now you may serve the app locally with ./local_serve
```

The site will now served locally at http://localhost:3000/
