# Slpy's YelpCamp
YelpCamp is a Node.js web application from The Web Developer Bootcamp[ยน](#credits). A plain and simple social network website for my learning and demonstration. This project, Slpy's YelpCamp, is my version of YelpCamp. I started versioning it at revision 2 of YelpCamp (YelpCamp_v2). I'll code to achieve almost the same result as the final version in the course, v11, but with possibilities of some minor adjustments to my preference. The goal is to learn full-stack web development try some relevant coding skills.

See pending development here: [readme_devList.md](readme_devList.md).

## Deployment
The code use MongoDB to store data and it access the database with the URL stored in environment variable DATABASEURL. For example, to start the application on the server in Bash with MongoDB instance in localhost, you may started it with the following CLI script in the root directory of this project: 
```bash
export DATABASEURL="mongodb://localhost/yelp_camp"
node app.js
```
