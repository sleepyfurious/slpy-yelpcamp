# 20190815 About this file
This file notes a list of development items from Colt's YelpCamp V1 to his final V11 and beyond. As watched his course video, I also made notes with my comments and fixes those were covered by his TA, Ian. The items' progress is marked with checkboxes. I'll code to achieve the result as same as his V11 version, but with possibilities of some minor adjustments that I believe to give better, cleaner code that I might do easily. After finish the work and remove all "wip", the√•re is the "aftermath" part that I might come back to take a look and add some additional feature later.

# YelpCamp V8

## Users + Comments
- [ ] Associate users and comments
- [ ] Save author's name to a comment automatically

* reminder: It wouldn't be very efficient if we had to look up the correct author every time by taking an author ID then finding that author and then finding it username.

* reminder: We can count on there being a request out user because the only way we get here to this code is if the user is locked in. And that's because we have the isLoggedIn Middleware up there.

# YelpCamp V9

## Users + Campgrounds
- [ ] Prevent an unauthenticated user from creating a campground
- [ ] Save username+id to newly created campground

# YelpCamp V10

- [ ] Add Update Route

## Deleting Campgrounds
- [ ] Add Destroy Route

* reminder: if you want the delete route for campgrounds to also delete any associated comments.. the code still don't do it. Ian have the solution here: https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/v4/questions/6168552

## Authorization Part 1: Campgrounds
- [ ] User can only edit his/her campgrounds
- [ ] User can only delete his/her campgrounds
- [ ] Hide/Show edit and delete buttons

* reminder: we can't just use === of course because one is mongoose's object and the other is a string. But, why not just use type coercioned equal operator when comparing foundCampground.author.id and req.user.\_id. why use foundCampground.author.id.equals(req.user.\_id)

## Editing Comments
- [ ] Add Edit route for comments
- [ ] Add Edit button
- [ ] Add Update route

## Deleting Comments
- [ ] Add Destroy route
- [ ] Add Delete button

- [ ] User can only delete his/her comments
- [ ] Hide/Show edit and delete buttons
- [ ] Refactor Middlewares into their separate file

# YelpCamp V11
"Usability"

## Adding in Flash!
- [ ] flash messages: see once
* reminder: Bootstrap has alert component with different colors built in!
* reminder: undefined is not truthy, empty array is truthy.
* reminder:
  ```javascript
  if(err){
    req.flash("error", err.message);
    return res.redirect("/register"); // instead of return res.render("register");
  }
  ```
* reminder: So we're taking advantage of "err" for our message.
* reminder: Fix the middleware in the screen shot on Desktop! and everything else findById, 
there's a small issue with our app in production. The show and edit routes aren't handling errors properly so the application can crash under certain circumstances. or to fix it..just see more here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDWPJAzlBfM&feature=youtu.be

## Landing Page
* see tutorial here: https://github.com/nax3t/background-slider. follow it!
 * modernizr.js is to make old browser likes internet explorer <= 8.0 behave with css more like modern browser.
 * separate landing.css that is used just for this page
 * css property "animation" is going to allow us to actually fade images in and out. infinite value is to loop infinitly.

## Aftermath
* I might later add features like google map and fuzzy search: https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/lecture/6754188#content
